# Liability Landmines: How Lax Security Measures Can Put Your Business in the Legal Crosshairs

In an era of increasing data breaches, inadequate security isn't just a technical gap, it's a legal ticking time bomb. Learn how seemingly small oversights in access control and data protection can expose businesses to crippling liability, and discover practical steps to minimize your risk.

## Introduction

Businesses of every size are under mounting pressure to protect sensitive data. When an organization's security posture is weak, especially in areas like access control or policy enforcement, the legal consequences can be swift and severe. In this talk, we'll dissect the intersection of cybersecurity and liability, revealing the most common pitfalls that can leave businesses exposed to lawsuits, regulatory fines, and reputational damage.

## Why This Topic Matters
